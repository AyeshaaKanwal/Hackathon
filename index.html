                    The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the only probiotic formulation recommended and recognized by name in the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the management of pouchitis and other pouch-related disorders 
                    (<a href="#">Olleik et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023</a>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included the De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) 
                    (<a href="#">ECCO, ECCO News, 2023</a>).
                    CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of various gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence, comprising over 200 peer-reviewed articles and more than 
                    <a href="#">80 controlled clinical studies</a>, ensures that the benefits observed in clinical trials are replicable in everyday use.

            </div>
            <div class="para">
                <p> Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
                    simply the sum of its individual component's actions but the result of a complex
                    network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
                    host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
                    from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.
                </p>
                <p>
                    CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
                    enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to
                    synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.
                    It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulation De Simone falls
                    within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product's
                    base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
                    knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
                    which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
                    efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate or
                    produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Based on extensive scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
                    dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering
                    proven and replicable clinical results.

                    Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine is altered, causing various gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for maintaining digestive health, improving patient comfort, and contributing to overall well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, and pouchitis.

            <h1 class="title">De <span>Simone</span> <span id="span2">Formulation</span></h1>
    
            <div class="section">
                <p>The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high-concentration probiotic mixtures to effectively manage acute and chronic gastrointestinal disorders.</p>
    
                <p>His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal flora's role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University of L'Aquila (Italy).</p>
    
                <p>He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <p>Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has actively advocated for better regulation and quality control of probiotics, highlighting the potential health and well-being risks.</p>
    
                <p>As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018).</p>
    
                <p>Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and safety of the commercially distributed probiotic product.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="subtitle">There is ONE <br>De <span>Simone</span> <span id="span2">Formulation</span></h2>
    
                <p>The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3&#174; by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.</p>
    
                <p>In 2019, VSL#3&#174; distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information: <a href="#"><u>Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of VSL#3&#174;</u></a>, Schulman Bhattacharya). Recently, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its guidelines to clarify that pre&#45;2016 literature references to VSL#3&#174; exclusively refer to DSF <u>(ECCO, ECCO News, 2023)</u>. In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism) published the article <em> <a href="#"> <u> "Clarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature: The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3&#174;</u> "</em></a> , which reiterates the above.</p>
    
                <p>The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name "Visbiome" in the USA and Canada (ExeGi) and under the brand name "De Simone Formulation" in Korea (Hearthotecare).</p>
